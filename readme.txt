HELP/INFORMATION -- PLEASE READ
===============================

This program was developed with Visual Foxpro 9 SP1 and is used to add new game files to a currently installed version of Unreal Tournament. It copies files from the source directory into the appropriate directory within the game install directory. It searches a specified folder and it's subfolders for game files and then uses a mappings table to determine where the files need to go in the game directory. For example, files with the .uax extension need to be placed in the sounds folder. 

The mappings can be modified to include any file extensions for any version of UT. The current version of UTFile comes with extension mappings for GOTY and 2004 versions. 

(The program can also be used with other files not associated with Unreal Tournament.)
