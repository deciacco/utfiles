Prison Yard

The main intention of the design of prison yard was to create a dog-fighting arena. A limited supply of power-ups and weapons makes the map a bit more difficult to play.  Plus the open areas create the necessity to fight or be killed. With a good opponent you will work up a sweat playing this map. So much for the gym!

I tried to keep the file size of the map down so it would be good for servers. I used existing ut textures so that additional files would not be needed.


Prison Yard is in the current rotation on the "Come To TJ's Junior" server.
