---- Author's Notes ----

This map was originally conceived for a Clan map. After completion and some changes
and suggestions by friends, i decided to make this a submission to the MSUC2003 Phase2 contest.
*this is labled as CTF-SHOGUNone because the original file had some un forseen problems. everything has been corrected.
