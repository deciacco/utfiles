Description             : 
	
	The late 24th century saw a rash of private arenas being built by some of the more wealthy corporations in the galaxy. Liandri, in what many believe to be a deliberate move, allowed this practice to continue. Soon the owners were gambling amongst themselves with ownerships frequently changing hands in ill-advised wagers. But money buys the best champions and it wasn't soon before the number of private arenas dwindled to only a handful of privateers. These venues are now frequently used as "Challenge Arenas," where locals meet in a sort of "tough guy" competition. This is one such theater.

Author's Notes
--------------
   Originally wanted to make this level in four hours, but it took six. It's been a while since the Playground [url]http://www.unrealplayground.com/[/url] had a mapping contest, and I know everyone has been getting itchy, so this was an informal six hour challenge to any who wanted to participate.
