build date:	January the 5th 2000
version   :     2.50

updates & infos:
----------------
-------------
version 2.50:
-------------
compiled using UnrealTournament.
Some classes not longer supported by UT were removed
(ie. PickupMine, BowyKnife)

-------------
version 2.20:
-------------
ONLINE PROBLEMS FIXED !!!
+ CRM (Mover.ControlRotatatingMover)
+ ControlRocket (Projectile.Rocket.ControlRocket)

both now work ONLINE...

-------------
version 2.12:
-------------
+ some little 'overall' changes
+ ControlRockets now can kill the instigator only after 1 sec flying
  (before it was possible to be killed instantly if fired with some weapons)
+ little bugs like warning messages fixed

-------------
version 2.11:
-------------
+ CRM now feautures Double-Cannon capability and a new FireOffset
  if you want to build a double-cannon you don't have to build TWO
  CRMs now. Only ONE is needed!
  In the new submenu ControlSpecialFire you have the chance to enter
  a FireOffset. It's similar to the one used in the weapon classes.
  The old FirePositionOffset (still existing) only moves the projectile
  into the direction of the current rotation. Now the new FireOffset
  can be used to move the spawning position of a projectile or instant-
  hit to any position you specify. Normaly you'll just use its y-value
  to move it to the right or left.
  In addition you can set the bDoubleFire parameter to True. So two
  projectiles or instanthits will be spawned at the same time. The
  second one is spawned at the y-value * -1.
  So, you get a double cannon with just ONE CRM !!!

-------------
version 2.10:
-------------
+ CRM's (ControlRotatingMovers) min/max values now work perfect
  if you reach the yaw min/max values the CRM will now switch
  around if the controler continues turning.
  ie. if you turn a 'cannon' to the min yaw it stays in this position
      until the controler reaches the center rotation between min and
      max yaw. If the controler continues turning in the max yaw
      direction the 'cannon' switches to the max yaw position.
  so, the problem of turning around several times and the cannon stays
  in the min or max position until you redo all rotation, is fixed!

+ SpecialMines now explode by TakeDamage events
  the former version exploded ONLY by a direct hit and InstantHit
  weapons haven't got a chance to harm it in any way.
  Now you can create chain reactions with a single blast, or cover
  a whole room with mines and the poor guy who steps on ONE single mine
  blows up the whole room...
  The 'health' of the SpecialMines is set to 18 by default. So, you
  have to shoot it twice with an AutoMag. But, just fire an eightball
  rocket near a bunch of mines and all will explode!
  Lot of fun :) !!

+ ElevatorButton stuff using ElevatorMoverInsideButtons
  corrected some lines of code (my elevators now work perfect...)
  Use this classes (and more) in combination to build 'real' elevators
  with in- and outside buttons, elevator doors and bot-support
  A detailed description can be found directly inside the 
  Mover.ElevatorButton script...

+ PickupMover
  If you don't have a mesh for your Inventory class,
  or if you just want to 'build' one for it inside UnrealEd...
  use this class...
  In addition:
  up to TEN (10) Inventory objects with only one touch possible!

+ InventoryZone
  Use this for predefined Inventory when entering / leaving this Zone
  use this ZoneInfo with bNoInventory for StartupZones
  like a RestRoom or ChatRoom... and use the ExitZone-Inventory entries
  to setup any inventory!
  !!! this variant is working with every game type !!!
  You can specify up to twenty (20) Inventory classes to add and
  up to 20 to subtract (or just delete the whole inventory) if
  a player enters this zone. Same for leaving.
  Try a combination with WarpZones and PlayerStarts... it's possible
  to setup diffrent types of players. ie. one with an AutoMag and a
  ShieldBelt and another with an EightBall and some Grenades all
  done by respawning inside an InventoryZone and 'falling' into a
  WarpZone that replaces your original PlayerStart

+ RotatingCamera2 in combination with ViewSpot to 'get around' an
  Unreal Engine 'bug' ...

+ ControlRocket now performs better
  You can control this rocket like the RazorBlade.
  In addition you 'fly' with her while you control it!
  This thingy works similar to the upcoming
  GuidedRocket from UnrealTournament !!

+ ControlRocketSeeking
  like the ControlRocket + if the controler presses Fire AND AltFire
  the rocket will start searching for a target by itself !!

+ AirStrike now features special events for triggering other stuff
  like movers, sounds or even some sort of cutscenes
  You can select any of the AirStrikes 'time points' to start and
  end the wanted event. (Start = TriggerEvent; End = UnTriggerEvent)

+ some speed and net performance stuff

Ok, that's not all but I think I got all the newest stuff listed above!

If you encounter any problems, are in need of additional information
or have some cool ideas what I could include inside the next version...
feel free to send an e-mail to:

nb_beppo@gmx.net or beppo@planetunreal.com

see ya,

Beppo

Have fun and enjoy !! :)
