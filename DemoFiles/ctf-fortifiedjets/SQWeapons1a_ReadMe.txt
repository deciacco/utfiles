//================================================

SQWeapons are improved versions of the original QJet weapons,
specially made to allow map makers to edit the important features of
the weapons by changing their default properties. Full details on how
to customize the weapons and info on the weapons in general is available at
http://wharthog.ntelos.net/hosted_sites/howie/sternjetweapons.htm

To add these weapons to a map, first install this map and the SQWeapons.utx
file. Open this map in UnrealEd, then open the map you want to add these
weapons to. The weapons and other items from this map will still be available
in the Actor browser. All of the items you add will become imbedded into your
map. Remember to distribute the SQWeapons.utx file with your map afterward!
You can edit the weapons to your liking, but please leave SQWeapons.utx
unchanged.

Changes since last version -

Added ability to change firing rate of the Ghandi Sniper Rifle and the
Titangun ]['s secondary, added option to make Titangun ]['s primary
shoot only non-seeking rockets.
